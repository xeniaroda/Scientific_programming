The first step of the process is to create in the MASTER branch (main) the file that will have our story: group story.
Then each member of the group has to create a new Branch (Xènia, Meritxell and Lucía). In each branch we will find the group story file that was just created in the main branch. 

After our Branch is created, we can start modifying the group story file in our own branch. Once modified the file with a different part of the whole story we commit the changes in our Branch.

The final step will be that all the members will merge their files in their branches to the main branch. The second and third person that would merge the file, will have to resolve the conflicts in order to do the merge correctly.

After all of that we can see the changes that the members did in the group story file on the main branch.
